# Health Regeneration Overhaul

This API changes the way health is regenerated. Instead of depending on the hunger system, three new entity attributes are
used.

The vanilla hunger system including exhaustion and saturation is disabled by default.

Additionally, an entity attribute called **_generic.reserved_health_** is added.

## Default implementation

Health is regenerated by **_generic.health_regeneration_** every **_generic.health_tick_threshold_** ticks.

When health is reduced, regeneration is stopped for **_generic.health_regeneration_delay_threshold_** ticks.

**_generic.reserved_health_** describes the percentage amount of maximum health that is currently not available.

### Default attribute values

- **_generic.health_regeneration_**: 0
- **_generic.health_tick_threshold_**: 100
- **_generic.health_regeneration_delay_threshold_**: 100
- **_generic.reserved_health_**: 0

## Customization

When the vanilla gamerule "naturalRegeneration" is true, players have 1 additional health regeneration.

In the client config an alternative health bar can be enabled and customized.

In the server config, the vanilla food system can be re-enabled.

## API

Casting a "LivingEntity" to the "HealthRegeneratingEntity" interface gives access to all relevant methods.
