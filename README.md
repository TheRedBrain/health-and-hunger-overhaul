# Health Regeneration Overhaul
This API changes the way health is regenerated. Instead of depending on the hunger system, two new entity attributes are used.

The hunger system including exhaustion and saturation is disabled by default, but it can be re-enabled in the server config.

## Default implementation
Health is regenerated by **_generic.health_regeneration_** every **_generic.health_tick_threshold_** ticks.

When health is reduced, regeneration is stopped for **_generic.health_regeneration_delay_threshold_** ticks.

### Default attribute values
- **_generic.health_regeneration_**: 0
- **_generic.health_tick_threshold_**: 100
- **_generic.health_regeneration_delay_threshold_**: 100

## Customization
When the vanilla gamerule "naturalRegeneration" is true, players have a health regeneration of at least 1.

In the client config an alternative health bar can be enabled and customized. The details are explained in [this wiki article](https://github.com/TheRedBrain/overhauled-damage/wiki/Resource-Bar-Customization).

## API
Casting a "LivingEntity" to the "HealthRegeneratingEntity" interface gives access to all relevant methods.
